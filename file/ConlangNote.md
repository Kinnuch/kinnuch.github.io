# Feature Focus

## Nonconcatenative Morphology

### Umlaut

tan > tani > tini > tin

ret > retaa > rataa > rata

### Metathesis

pem > pemlu > pelmu > pelm

pem > pemroo > permoo > permo

saatu > kasaatu > ksaatu > skaatu

in + sulat > *insulat > sinulat

### Coda Rhotics/L-vocalization

tesh > teshlu > telshu > telsh > teysh > tiish

tesh > teshroo > tershoo > tersho > taasho

### Epenthesis

ka-shofa > kshofa > shkofa > shkof > shukof

shof-tu > shoftu > shoft > shofut

### Summary

thus a word like [sepeto] after conjugations above, are well conjugated and act like from root [s-p-t]. But not 100% succeed. Need subtle adjustments called Analogy.

### Analogy

E.g English: to dare > durst > dared, to help > holp > helped

## Irregularity

Very important to apply a proto-language

Test Language:

C:m/n p/b t/d k/g h s l

V:a,i,u

max=CVn

### Sound change

assume that -lu is past: kipa > kipalu sati > satilu

l after n > d: tun > tunlu > tundu

This is called [Regular Irregularity]

then make coda vowel to lose:

kipa/kipalu > kip/kipal sati/satilu > sat/satil puna/punalu > pun > punal

tun/tundu stays!

thus A/I/U conjugation patterns are made. and [tundu] is considered irregular.(compare pun and tun)

### Intrusion and anti-intrusion

Another way is to set another system in the mid and those are used frequently get retained while the other adopted the new system(or some use the new system but to often to 'wrongly' back to the older system)

### Simplify

And another way to form irregularity is by simplify the complex older system to get a new one. e.g maken > maked to maken > made

### To be

To be:

es- > esmi > eam > am

es- > esthe > earun > are

es- > esti > is > is

### Suppletion

Problem of go > went

eode 'advanced'  > gan 'advance' > go

wended 'proceeded' > wende 'proceed' > went

another example:

ghedh 'to unite, suit' > gooda- 'fitting, suitable'

bhad 'good' > bataz batizo batistaz 'good/better/best'

Navajo helps to explain how do different words come to one

to run(one person) < to bend + reflexive

to run(two people) < to flee + reciprocal

PIE:

es- 'to be' > an/is/are

wes- 'to remain' > was/were 

bheue- 'to exist' > be/been/being
