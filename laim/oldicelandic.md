## Phonology & Orthography

### Vowel

#### Monophthong

1. á [ɔ:]
2. a [ɑ]
3. é [e:]
4. e [e]

8. o [o]
9. ú [u:]
10. u [u]
11. ý [y:]
12. y [y]

17. t [t]
18. v [v]
19. w [w]
20. x [ks]
21. z [ts]
22. þ [θ]

### Stress

Mostly **initial stressed**, secondary stress on the last syllable

Consonants cluster after long vowels are **valid**, thus those syllables are super long syllables.

**non-initial syllables start always as vowels**

> hundraða > hundr - að - a

### Umlaut-Vowel Harmonization(latter affects former)

**i-mutation/u-mutation**	front vowel mutation/back vowel mutation

i-mutation:(i/j lead)	former vowel **advances** while roundness **remains**

- a > e
- á > æ
- o > ø
- ó > œ
- u/ju > y
- ú/jú > ý
- ǫ > ø
- au > ey

u-mutation:(u/v lead)	former vowel **gets more roundness**

- a > ǫ

- á > †ǫ́ > á

- e > ø

- é > œ

- i > y

- í > ý

  > for these four vowels e, é, i, í, the round process are rather irregular and not common

- unstressed a > u

**Condition: when i/u appears in the suffix, the conjugation or declension of N/V/Adj will apply i/u-mutation**

Some u-mutation happens where u is absent, because the u dropped at a rather early time

### Consonant Sound Change

#### Consonant lengthening

-t/r after long vowel stem will be long (-tt/-rr)

#### Consonant simplification

Cluster plus consonant where the presuming result has long consonant after consonant will get shortened

> fagr + -rar > fagrar

#### Consonant assimilation

Five major rules:

1. -r assimilates former l/s/n when they are in a long syllable

   > sæl + -r > sæll
   >
   > væn + -r > vænn

2. -ð- assimilates former ð and generates -dd-

   > eyða > †eyðði > eyddi

   -ð- also assimilates former t/s(sometimes also k) and generates -tt-/-st/-kt-

   > setja > †setði > setti
   >
   > kyssa > †kysði > kysti
   >
   > kneikja > †kneikði > kneikti

3. -ð/d- assimilates latter -t and generates -tt-

   > kaldt > kaltt > kalt

4. -nn- sometimes is assimilated by -r and generates -ð

   > mann + -r > maðr
   >
   > annar + ... > ann(a)r + ... > aðr...

5. -k- + -ð- generates -tt-

   > sœkja > †sókði > sótti
   >
   > þykkja > †þókði > þótti

#### Unvoiced end

Consonants cluster in the end first become **unvoiced**, and then get **assimilated**, mostly in past tense conjugation.

> -nd > -tt-
>
> -ng > -kk-
>
> -ld > -lt

#### Consonant dropping

Unstressed -n-/-l- sometimes drops before -t

> mikil + -t > mikit
>
> búin + -t > búit

### Other Sound Change

#### Syncope and contraction

Syncope: unstressed short vowel drops

> himin + -i  > himni

Contraction: when an unstressed vowel followed by a stressed vowel(say AB), there is a contraction

- if A and B are both front or back(except úa/óa and sometimes úu), they merge and generate a long vowel

  > *fáa > fá

- if A is back and B is front, they remain as untouched

  > búinn

- if A is front and B is back, they generate diphthong

  > *féar > fjár(with vowel fracture)
  >
  > *knéum > knjám/knjóm

#### Vowel fracture

*e > ja

#### Other lengthening or shortening

- stressed vowel at end are lengthened

  > þu > þú

- although long vowels before consonants cluster are valid, long vowel are often **shortened** before cluster, especially before **long consonants**

  > eitt + -gi > ekki

#### *Retention of semi-vowel

Beginning j in Proto-Germanic drops. So beginning j in Old Norse came from **fracture**.

> Old Norse ungr - Old English geong

Before front vowel i/y/ø/œ and sometimes e, **middle j drops**. In other situation, if j is after g/k or a short syllable, j **retains**.

> veljum - velið(†veljið)

j after long vowel becomes i, this also happens when j is after a short syllable ended with g.

i-stem noun when after a long syllable stem ended with k/g becomes -j- before -a/u in suffix.

Beginning w**(v in icelandic)** in Proto-Germanic drops when l/r is after.

> Old Norse líta - Old English wlitan

Before rounded vowel u/y/o/ø/œ, **w drops**.

> verða > Past tense urðu/Past Particle orðinn
>
> Old Norse œpa - Old English wēpan

After ó/ú, **w drops**.

> Old Norse glóa - Old English glowan

At end or before consonant, w also drops.

Middle w when after g/k or a short syllable **retains**.

## Morphology

### Verb conjugation

Category: 

- 3 grammatical persons
- 2 numbers: single, plural
- 2 tenses: present, past
- 3 moods: indicative, subjunctive, imperative
- 2 voices: active, middle(like reflexive verb)

#### Strong Verb(Ablaut, from PIE)

Seven categories where the former six are quite regular:

**Category-Infinitive-(3sg.pre)-3sg.pst-3pl.pst-(3sg.pst.sub)-p.p.**

1. b**í**ta ’bite’-b**í**tr-b**ei**t-b**i**tu-b**i**ti-b**i**tinn
2. sk**jó**ta ’shoot’-sk**ý**tr-sk**au**t-sk**u**tu-sk**y**ti-sk**o**tinn
3. br**e**sta ’burst’-br**e**str-br**a**st-br**u**stu-br**y**sti-br**o**stinn
4. b**e**ra ’bear’-b**e**rr-b**a**r-b**á**ru-b**æ**ri-b**o**rinn
5. r**e**ka ’drive’-r**e**kr-r**a**k-r**á**ku-r**æ**ki-r**e**kinn
6. f**a**ra ’go/fare’-f**e**rr-f**ó**r-f**ó**ru-f**œ**ri-f**a**rinn

3sg.pre is closely related with infinitive, and 3sg.pst.sub is definitely the result of **i-mutation** of 3pl.pst.

So we regard infinitive, 3sg.pst, 3pl.pst and p.p. as **:one:/:two:/:three:/:four:** vowel representative respectively. 

- infinitive without -a is :one:
- 3sg.pst is :two:
- 3pl.pst without -u is :three:
- p.p. without -inn is :four:

##### Second strong conjugation

Basic: **jú/jó(ý) > au > u(y) > o**, parenthesis indicates forms when **i-mutation** is applied. jó is the product of jú > jó when there is **ð/d/s/t**

Special:

- stem with ending -g, g drops and lengthen the vowel
- stem with ending -s, weak conjugation is valid
- **lúka** ’finish’, **súpa** ’sip’, **lúta** ’bow’ conjugate like second type strong verb, although there is no j

> infinitive: skjóta ’shoot’

> **Present Particle**: skjótandi
>
> **Past Particle**: skotinn

##### Third strong conjugation

Basic: **e/i > a > u(y) > u/o** and the stem is always with a **double consonant ending**. i is the product of **e followed by n**(but **brenna** ’burn’ and **renna** ’run’ is special). o is the product of **u followed by l/r**.

Special:

- v drops before o/u

  > verða ’become’ > verð-, varð-, **urð**-, orð-

- -nd > -tt, -ng > -kk and -ld > -lt in single past

  > binda > †band > batt
  >
  > gjalda ’pay’ > gjalt

- in infinitive and plural present, **ja is fractured from e** when e is followed by a consonant cluster that starts with a l/r.

  > †gelda > gjalda > single present: geld, geldr, geldr plural present: gjǫldum

- infinitive with a -va ending applies u-mutation first, thus **a > ǫ, i > y, e > ø**. And -va was wholly removed when applying :three: and :four: types.​ -v drops when no suffix or -r is added.

  > †sekkva > søkkva ’sink’
  >
  > søkkv-, sǫkkv-, **sukk-, sokk-**
  >
  > sg.pre søkk, søkkr, søkkr
  >
  > †singva > syngva ’sing’
  >
  > singv-, sangv-, sung-, song-
  >
  > sg.pst sǫng not **sǫkk**, because actually there is a -v- in the end
  
- irregular verb

  > **finna** ’find’
  >
  > **finn-, fann-, fund-, fund-**
  >
  > **bregða** ’hasten’
  >
  > **bregð-, brá-, brátt, brá-**

##### Fourth strong conjugation

Basic: **e > a > á(æ) > o/u**, infinitives have l/m/r/n as an ending

very regular

> bera ’carry, bear’ > bar > báru > borinn
>
> nema ’take’ > nam > námu > numinn

since the fourth type is very similar to the fifth type, we cover them together.

##### Fifth strong conjugation

Basic: **e > a > á(æ) > o**, infinitives have any consonant **except l/m/r/n** as an ending

Special: some infinitives end with -ja, thus i-mutation causes **e > i** which is retained in all **present** conjugations. **-ja verbs are like -va verbs.**

> †beðja > b**i**ðja ’ask, demand, bid’
>
> †setja > s**i**tja ’sit’

There are two even more irregular -ja verbs(which are caused by double consonant **gg**):

> liggja ’lie(lie down)’ > †laggj(which is expected to be :two:) > lá > lág 
>
> þiggja ’accept’ > þá > þág
>
> vega > vá > vág

More confusing examples are infinitives with v in root, like sofa and vefa:

> sofa ’sleep’
>
> root: svef-
>
> single present: **sef(søf), sefr(søfr), sefr(søfr)**
>
> plural present: sofum, sofið, sofa
>
> single past: svaf, svaft, svaf
>
> plural past: sváfum, sváfuð, sváfu

> vefa ’weave’
>
> root: vef-
>
> single present: vef, vefr, vefr
>
> plural present: vefum, vefið, vefa
>
> single past: †vaf > **óf, óft, óf**
>
> plural past: **ófum, ófuð, ófu**

Another irregular verb is **troða ’tread’**, with pattern **o > a > á > o**

In the end, considering verb **sjá ’see’**, which is highly **irregular**:

> infinitive: sjá ’see’
>
> dictionary: sé, sjá, sá, sé
>
> :one: sé:two: sjá:three: sá:four: sé
>
> **indicative:**
>
> - single present
>   - 1st person: sé
>   - 2nd person: sér
>   - 3rd person: sér
> - plural present
>   - 1st person: sjám
>   - 2nd person: séð(sjáið)
>   - 3rd person: sjá
> - single past
>   - 1st person: sá
>   - 2nd person: sátt
>   - 3rd person: sá
> - plural past
>   - 1st person: sám
>   - 2nd person: sáuð
>   - 3rd person: sá(sáu)
>
> **Subjunctive**
>
> - single present
>   - 1st person: sé
>   - 2nd person: sér
>   - 3rd person: sé(sjái/sjáir)
> - plural present
>   - 1st person: sém
>   - 2nd person: séð
>   - 3rd person: sé
> - single past
>   - 1st person: sæa
>   - 2nd person: sæir
>   - 3rd person: sæi
> - plural past
>   - 1st person: sæim
>   - 2nd person: sæið
>   - 3rd person: sæi
>
> **Imperative**
>
> - you: sér
> - we: sjám
> - you(pl.): séð(sjáið)
>
> **Infinitive**: sjá
>
> **Present Particle**: sjándi
>
> **Past Particle**: séður

##### Sixth strong conjugation

Basic: **a(e) > ó > ó(æ) > a/e**, e in past particle is the result of **ending k/g**.

Special:

- some ending g drops, like in the first and second types

  > draga ’drag’ > **dró**

- some ending nd acts weirdly, where n drops and d gets assimilated and produces ð:

  > standa ’stand’ > **stóð > stóð > stað**

- some -ja words lead i-mutation, thus all the **present conjugations** are affected:

  > sverja
  >
  > hefja

- like fifth type, structure like **v + back vowel** will lose v in **past conjugations**:

  > sverja > **sór, sórt, sór**
  >
  > vaxa > **óx, óxt, óx**
  >
  > vaða > **óð, ótt, óð**

- other irregular verbs:

  > slá ’slay’ > slóg > slóg > sleg
  >
  > single present: slæ, slær, slær
  >
  > plural present: slám, sláið, slá
  >
  > single past: †slag > **sló, slótt, sló**
  >
  > plural past: **slógum, slóguð, slógu**

  > deyja ’die’
  >
  > single present: dey, deyr, deyr
  >
  > plural present: deyjum, deyið, deyja
  >
  > single past: **dó, dótt, dó**
  >
  > plural past: **dóm, dóð, dó**

  > hlæja ’laugh’
  >
  > single present: hlæ, hlær, hlær
  >
  > plural present: hlæjum, hlæið, hlæja
  >
  > single past: **hló, hlótt, hló**
  >
  > plural past: **hlógum, hlóguð, hlógu**

##### Seventh strong conjugation

Those that cannot fit into any of the former six types are called the **seventh type strong verbs**. They includes:

>a > á > ó
>
>a > e > e
>
>á > é > é
>
>au > jó > jó
>
>ei > é > é

The past forms of those verbs retain so-called **reduplicated** symbol in Proto-Germanic, which in return changes the pattern by **adding initial consonant right before the root**, thus producing such weird results.

> Old English hātan(German heißen) > past tense †he**h**t- > hēt

The typical patterns are as below, where :one: accords with :four:, and :two: accords with :three::

> Type 1: heita ’be called’ > hét > hétum > heitinn
>
> Type 2a: auka ’increase’ > jók > jókum > aukinn
>
> Type 2b: búa ’inhabit’ > bjó > b**ju**ggum > búinn
>
> Type 3: falla ’fall’ > fell > fellum > fallinn
>
> Type 4: láta ’let’ > lét > létum > látinn
>
> Type 5: blóta ’offer’ > blét > blétum > blótinn

There are also other extreme irregular ones that belong to the seventh type, their conjugation are as follows:

> ganga ’go, walk’ > geng(single past ge**kk**-) > geng > geng
>
> single present: geng, gengr, gengr
>
> plural present: gǫngum, gangið, ganga
>
> single past: **gekk, gekkt, gekk**
>
> plural past: gengum, genguð, gengu

> fá ’hand over, get’ > feng(single past fe**kk**-) > feng > feng
>
> single present: fæ, fær, fær
>
> plural present: fám, fáið, fá
>
> single past: **fekk, fekkt, fekk**
>
> plural past: fengum, fenguð, fengu

> halda ’hold’ > held(single past ha**lt**-) > heldum > haldinn
>
> single present: held, heldr, heldr
>
> plural present: hǫldum, haldið, halda
>
> single past: **helt, helzt, helt**
>
> plural past: heldum, helduð, heldu

> hǫggva ’hew’ > **hjó > hjuggum**
>
> single present: høgg, høggr, høggr
>
> plural present: hǫggum, hǫggvið, hǫggva
>
> single past: **hjó, hjótt, hjó**
>
> plural past: **hjuggum, hjugguð, hjuggu**

Some words even retain the reduplicated forms:

> róa ’row’
>
> single present: rœ, rœr, rœr
>
> plural present: róm, róið, róa
>
> single past: **rera, rerir, reri**, where e can be ø
>
> plural past: **rerum, reruð, reru**, where e can be ø

> sá ’sow’
>
> single present: sæ, sær, sær
>
> plural present: sám, sáið, sá
>
> single past: **sera, serir, seri**, where e can be ø
>
> plural past: **serum, seruð, seru**, where e can be ø

> snúa ’turn’
>
> single present: sný, snýr, snýr
>
> plural present: snúm, snúið, snúa
>
> single past: **snera, snerir, sneri**, where e can be ø
>
> plural past: **snerum, sneruð, sneru**, where e can be ø

**gróa ’grow’** and **gnúa ’rub’** have nothing to do with róa and snúa in the ancient times, but due to **analogy** they are both now conjugate like róa and snúa respectively.

#### Weak Verb

Weak verbs plus **-ði-** to form past tense, and according to the vowel in the stem, weak verbs can be divided into **three** groups.

> sigl-**i/j**-
>
> kall-**a**-
>
> lif-**i**-
>
> the former vowel is called **root vowel** and the latter one is called **stem vowel** which differs with groups.

##### Common sound changes in weak conjugation

- deletion of i

  > i in ði vanishes before vowel
  >
  > stem vowel i/j or i drops before -ði-

- **u-mutation**(pay attention to unstressed **a > u**)

  > kall-a-ði-um > †kalluðum > **kǫlluðum**
  >
  > tal-i/j-ði-uð > †talðuð > **tǫlðuð**

- -ð + ð- > -dd-

  > auð-i/j > eyða
  >
  > eyð-ði-a > eyðða > **eydda**

- **sometimes** -n + ð- > -nd-

  > munu ’will’ : mun-ði > **mundi**
  >
  > but stefna > **stefnði**

- -t/s + ð- > -tt/st

  > flut-i/j > flytja
  >
  > flytj-ði-a > †flytða > **flytta**
  >
  > þeys-ði-a > †þeysða > **þeysta**

- **sometimes** -p/k/f/l + ð- > -pt/kt/ft/lt

  > þurfa ’need’: þurf-ði-a > †þurfða > **þurfta**
  >
  > but hafa ’have’: haf-ði-a > **hafða**

- -Cdd/Ctt > -Cd/C

  > senda ’send’: send-i/j-ði-a > †sendða > **senda**

And we only need **three representatives** for weak verbs because the past tense of weak verbs share the same stem not like in the strong case. Thus infinitive, 3sg.pst, p.p. are :one:/:two:/:three:.

##### First weak conjugation

Stem vowel: **i/j**, when final syllable is **short**, j is chosen, otherwise i is chosen.

And **i is retained in both present and past**, but **j is only retained in present**.  Notedly, whenever there is a i/j in the stem vowel slot, **i-mutation** is applied, therefore both present and past forms in i’s case are mutated while only present forms are mutated in j’s case.

> var-i/j- > ver-j- > var-
>
> sigl-i/j- > sigl-i- > sigl-i-
>
> skil-i/j- > skil-j- > skil-
>
> stafn-i/j- > stefn-i- > stefn-i-
>
> sát-i/j- > sæt-i- > sæt-i-

Some special cases:

- long syllables with k/g endings, -i- turns to -j- before **a/u**

  > lág-i/j- > 3pl.pre †lægia > læg**j**a

- short syllables with g endings, -j- turns to -i- before **single consonant or nothing** in **present tense**.

  > sag-i/j- > 1sg.pre †segj > seg**i**

- some short syllables with g endings may double g in **present tense**

  > lag-i/j > legg-j-

##### Second & Third Weak Conjugation

Second: -a- may drop if it is followed by a vowel, sometimes it turns to -u- due to u-mutation

Third: -i- may drop if it is followed by a vowel. And it differs from the first type because the -i- here **does not trigger i-mutation**. -i- in the third type does not show up in the past tense.

Special: verbs with -á ending **drops and only drops -i- in 3pl.pre** and don’t need to supply any -a

> ná ’reach,get’:
>
> single present: nái, náir, náir
>
> plural present: náum, náið, ná
>
> single past: náða, náðir, náði
>
> plural past: náðum, náðuð, náðu

#### Preterite-present Verb

This type of verbs apply past tense pattern of strong verbs in their present tense and conjugate as weak verbs in past tense. Only 10 in Old Nose.

How does this weird conjugation pattern exist? Because generally past tense conjugation in Proto-Germanic came from perfect aspect in Proto-Indo-European, but in those words above the perfect aspect became present tense inversely, thus their blank past tense were filled by weak conjugation pattern.

Sometimes they even have present infinitive and past infinitive.
